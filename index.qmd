# Open Research Practice Guide Overview

This document serves as a template provided by the LMU Open Science Center (OSC) to assist research groups at LMU in creating their own tailored Open Research Practice Guide.
Our goal is to help your research group establish and communicate clear expectations and workflows that foster a culture of transparent, reproducible, credible, and ethical research. This guide is intended to be collaboratively developed by all members of your group – including students (Bachelor, Master, PhD), postdoctoral researchers, staff scientists, technicians, and Principal Investigators – involved in the research process.
The handbook follows the typical Research Data Management (RDM) lifecycle (Plan & Design -> Collect & Manage -> Analyse & Collaborate -> Preserve & Share), integrating Open Science practices at each stage. We recommend including a visual workflow diagram in your adapted version for quick reference. 

The guide is structured as follows:

-   **How to Use and Adapt this Guide**: This section provides an overview of the guide's structure and how to adapt it for your research group.
-   **Inroduction and Guiding Principles**: This section outlines the guiding principles of the guide, including the importance of open research practices and the benefits they bring to your research group.
-   **Research Data Management (RDM) Lifecycle**: This section provides an overview of the RDM lifecycle and how it relates to open research practices.
-   **Plan & Design**: This section covers the planning and design phase of the research process, including how to develop a research question, design a study, and create a data management plan.
-   **Collect & Manage**: This section covers the data collection and management phase of the research process, including how to collect and manage data in a way that promotes transparency and reproducibility.
-   **Analyse & Collaborate**: This section covers the analysis and collaboration phase of the research process, including how to analyze data in a transparent and reproducible way and how to collaborate with other researchers.
-   **Preserve & Disseminate**: This section covers the preservation and sharing phase of the research process, including how to preserve and share data in a way that promotes transparency and reproducibility.
-   **Resources**: Additional resources and links to relevant tools, software, and best practices for open research.         
-   **Appendix**: This section includes additional information, such as a glossary of terms and a list of relevant policies and guidelines.
